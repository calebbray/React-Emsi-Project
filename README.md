# Rough Draft for Emsi Project Using react

This is my follow up to my first Emsi Project repository

My goal is to recreate what I have done in the original project using React.

This is a very rough draft. There is not much styling that has been done. The chart's data is not complete yet and the second table has not yet been completed. It should also be noted that the data displayed also includes the 2018 year which is incomplete in the provided .json file. An updated version should be uploaded soon.

This project was created using the Create React App and should be able to run with an npm start command
